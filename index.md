# Exploring the Command Less

## What is the Command Less?

The command less puts the file's contents without opening the file on a text editor. What it does instead is it displays the text on the terminal for easy access.
his can be very useful when you have multiple files and just want to peek a file to see if it is the one you are looking. The command sounds very simple but it has a lot more to offer.
Navigating with the command less has useful features like looking for a specific word or setting "bookmarks". Fun fact, the name less comes from "less is more".

# Navigating Through Text Using less

To start with, to use less, you use the order `less [Option] filename`. This is the syntax. After you press enter, you will be displayed the contents of the file. 
To provide examples, I will be using the `technical` directory and open some text files. In my terminal I will type `less rr74.txt`. The output is a really long article so I 
will provide of picture of what is shown.
